    <h1>3.0 - Quirks, Tips, and Tricks</h1>

    <h2>3.1 - Debugger</h2>

    <h3>Tricks</h3>
    <p>We used some of GDB's built in formating functionality to make it easier to parse the output.  In particular is "set confirm off" which enables one to kill a running (but stopped) program without GDB asking for confirmation.  This also turns off a potentially useful function in the "display" command; when "display" is set with confirmation <u>on</u>, GDB returns a formated output string containing the information you wish to automatically display with each step (or an error message).  With confirmation <u>off</u>, "display" returns no output until the next step.</p>
    <p>Another useful trick is the "set prompt %" command we use.  When sending commands to GDB, the last character returned on the output stream (when it's all been collected) will be a "%" (with some important exceptions... like a run-away program) because of that command.</p>

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>The Debugger class has many accessor methods.  Most of them go unused within Chameleon, but when developing your own code and using this class, use them liberally to see what's going on inside.</p>

    <h2>3.2 - Networking / Processes</h2>

    <h3>Quirks</h3>
    <p>Most quirks have been explained within the code.</p>

    <h3>Tricks</h3>
    <p>Heavy use of start and end tokens are used during remote server execution.  Basically, they're just oddly-capitalized pieces of text that we can effectively guarantee would not be generated by the server, so we know they signify the start or end of our command.</p>
