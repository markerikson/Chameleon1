<p>Training for the use of CVS will be provided as needed.  The SCM Administrator will ultimately be responsible for this.
<p>Only one branch will be maintianed.  Developers will be responsible for updating the SCML as they achieve a stable status will parts of their development.  The SCML will be compiled for a release approximately once a month, starting in the second semester.
