<h1>5.0 Schedules and Resources</h1>

The CVS repository will be created within the next few days by Matt Sheppard.  
Initially, we plan to maintain both stable and unstable branches.  The unstable
branch will be updated frequently as we make our commits during each iteration.  
The stable branch will be updated at the end of each iteration with the features
we decide are stable.  Our CVS clients may include WinCVS and TortoiseCVS under
Windows, as well as the usual CVS program under Linux.  Mark and Dave are already
familiar with CVS, and will bring Ben up to speed on its use.
