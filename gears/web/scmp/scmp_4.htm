<h1>4.0 Activities</h1>

 <h2><a name="ID">4.1 Configuration Identification</a></h2>
  <p>All files will be listed in the Maintenance Manual.</p>

 <h2><a name="location">4.2 SCML Location</a></h2>
  <p>During the development of the project, the SCML is stored on David Czechowksi's server.  The IP address is 163.11.160.218.  The SCML root is located in <i>/home/cvsroot/gears</i>.  A read-only view of the SCML is provided at <a href="http://163.11.160.218/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/">http://163.11.160.218/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/</a></p>

 <h2><a name="control">4.3 Configuration Control</a></h2>
  <p>We will be using various CVS clients, depending on needs and current working platform.  Under Windows, this may include WinCVS and TortoiseCVS; under Linux, this may include Cervisia, and the command-line CVS client.
  <p>We will be maintaining one SCML, using CVS. To this, the SCM Users will commit all code changes.  At the end of each iteration, after advisement from the Test/QA Manager, the SCM Administrator will cvs-tag the code as a stable build release.
  <p>CVS provides the ability to record comments when making a checkin. Each checkin has its time and author listed as well.  This will serve as our main means of tracking changes.
  <p>We intend to maintain a policy of individual code ownership.  This should minimize conflicts involving multiple developers working on the same code.  Still, CVS is designed to handle multiple users working on the same file simultaneously, and is capable of intelligently merging file differences.  Should more than one developer be working on a file at the same time, problems should be minimal.</p>

 <h2><a name="reviews">4.4 Configuration Reviews/Audits</a></h2>
  <p>The SCM Administrator will monitor the SCML after each check-in/creation, and alert the team to problems that may have been caused by the changes.</p>

 <h2><a name="archive">4.5 SCML Archives</a></h2>
  <p>CVS is designed to do archiving, so no additional archiving will be done.
  <p>Because of the structure of cvs usage, every developer will have a working copy of the SCML in their development environment.  As a result, no explicit form of backup will be used.</p>
