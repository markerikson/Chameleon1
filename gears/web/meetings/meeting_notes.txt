	*Design Lead (how classes interact, functions, how things work): --WOW--
	*Requirements Lead: Mark?
	*Config Mngr: Dave?
	*Quality Assurance: Ben?
	*Testing: Ben?
>>Interview:

		-eg: handling restrictions (student/teacher)
	*Teacher / Student decides features.
	*Automation?
	*target age group of ultimate users?

Interview 9/15/2003 3:20pm
by: Ben
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

>>What he wants
	*syntax highlighting
	*code completion
	*www.parinya.ca
	*www.scintilla.org
	*our ability to port in code from off-the-counter freeware
	*other teams interaction (animated debugger, auto-grader) with us?

>>Requirements
    *The FLEX part of the IDE should provide a basic text-editor.  As time & complexity increase, the editor will provide nearly identical functionality to that of Visual C++, including a command-prompt window and syntax highlighting.
    *Control is to be implemented at our discretion.  Ultimate control for features should be given to the teacher, though students should be allowed to explore on their own.  The idea is of a master switch that makes them AVAILABLE, but not neccesarily open unless the student activates them.
    *The IDE is to include a debugger (import the animated debugger project?) and a terminal window that can connect to the linux servers.
    *Linux is the primary environment to run in.  Then Windows.
    *No preferences with development tools, nor problems with "off the shelf" code.

>>Features
    *debugger (with step functionality)
    *terminal window
    *syntax highlighting
    *code completion (typing class name auto-finishes)
    *%%code hiding%%  (if we can...)
    *master-control to the teacher
    *hidden complexity for simple/beginner students
    *full functionality for advanced students
    *some project handling
    *communication with the Linux servers
    *local / server based runtime for program

>>Documentation notes:
    *loosely follow templates, edit as we see fit

>>Process notes:
    *organize & operate as we see fit
    *suggested: give prog. hours to team leader
    *present deliverables to keep an external order
    *no real restriction to straight-process

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
>>Review:
	*IDE is run locally
	*2 options for compiling: server or client
	*-therefore, the CLI is very simple.  Still need the SSH session...
	*minimilistic commands?  simple command-line
	*some frustration with Gallagher & his Linux  :)
	
	*2 CLI: the terminal session, the command line thingy

	*IDE is completely GUI.  And there was much rejoicing.  YAY!
	*User is able to have files on local box, server box
	***solution: the save dialogue has 2-pane window.  Pane 1: local.  Pane 2: server
	***solution: two seperate save dialogues.  "Save on Server..." / "Save..."
	***note: compile local, compile server: make the current status obvious
	***solution: switch between remote & local
>>Discussion of issues:
	~the terminal is gonna be one of the most significant
	~SSH library
	~GUI Issues:
		*main function: transfer info from user to "managers"
		*keeps track of windows / frames / boxes / etc
		*doesn't send stuff to user persay, more or less passing from user
		*manager sends own messages
		*manager has to know what isn't allowed?
	~enable / disable issues:
		*showing / hiding of things, so GUI must communicate with PM
		*PM will pass messages, but not much else
	~editing management
		*editor window
		*everything that happens here.  Oui
		*communicates with debugger
		*communicates a little with compiler manager (compiler lets editor know what lines have problems)
	~compiler management
		*deals with terminal management
		*communicates with editor
		*communicates a little with network
		*communicates with debugger?
	~network management

Group Meeting 11/02/2003 11:33pm
by: Ben
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
>>Entry:
	-SDD 1.0 in.  2.0 due 13th Nov.
>>Stuff we had to do this week
	-Dave: exec thread -> problems with Cintella compiler, no success compiling.  Question from Ben about -g option in compilation for compiling.
	-Mark: in terms of debugging, using wxWindows "logdebug" for watching errors.  Worked on GUI.  Added debug buttons (play, pause, step over, step into, step out).  Did some work on disabling the save button if no modifications.  Knows how to handle events.
	-Ben: began permissions managing code.  Researched debugger.

>>To do:
	-Ben-->Bring book & get ready for Tuesday to discuss debugger.  Permissions
	-Mark->putting logdebug into section 5.5 of SDD.  Work out debugging buttons in sub-window?
	-Dave->same ole

by: Ben
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
>>Progress
	*SDD updated!  W00T!  ;)
	*Team meetings Tuesday
		~"Virtual Prof" looks easy to integrate
		~Animated Debugger?  Dave's skeptical. Low level integrate is plausible, but the high-level integration?  Not gonna happen.  Maybe middle of next semester things'll work out, but otherwise... no worries.

	*The Debugger: as simple as Ben had hoped.  Runs in its own window, so it can be piped.  Mark sees similarities with the networking wrapper.

	*Dave: Progress on the WXProcess.  Not integrated with Plink.

>>File manipulation talk
	*File open dialogue
	*SCP Use?  No.  SFTP to list files & port into dialogue.
	*Threading purposes?  Neccesity?
	*Plink can list.  SCP for copy files.  Or maybe just SFTP.

>>Questions
	*Threading with the blocking?
	*Is the terminal such a big deal?  Will it be hidden in most advanced form?
	*Where do we need to stand at end of semester?
		~some semblence of features together & working together.
		~3 WEEKS... and something needs to be put together

>>Stuff to do: (going to Project Manager)
	*Mark: wants to Lookup "The linux Development Platform", start list of items to put together
	*Ben: needs to start coding debugger
	*Dave?  He knows.  :)

	*Dave- tried to get the process class going.  Got distracted.
	*Ben- apparently got the wrong stuff.  Looking for minGW

>>Notes
	*Talk with Jake: doing same thing we're doing?
	*Confusion over Jake's group using the Linux box's GDB & not grabbing minGW.
	*List of specifics working by 20th?

>>To do

	*Putty issues?  Looking into putty-source to see if we can take advantage of it
	*Plink can port-forward...

>>Demo time completions (~###~ => optional, ~###% => strongly recommended)
	*Dave: General LVL1 user running.  Open files, ~listing remote files~, ~embedded terminal%, functional debugger
	*Mark: agree.  Text editor is running...
	*ben: no comment
	*Dave: terminal is *sorta* working.

>>Upcomming week:
	*Tuesday: <<<CODE DAY>>>

>>Things broken in the initial beta demo:
	-tab names?  fixed
	-caching? fixed
	-saving? working...
>>Release v2!!
	-user interface re-working
		~networking
		~open dialogue: if network connection fails, error message shows but open dialogue shows anyway.  kill.
		~starting Chameleon: clicking "open" results in "unknown network error"
		~Ben needs to play with it.
		~Local / Remote play with items... after / before the open dialogue?  BEFORE: it's standard, easier to code.
		~network transparency with debugging?  how will it make sense to the user?  USE CASE!!!
	-what do we need?
		~terminal (working & embedded).  Doable for next beta?
			*TA telnet?
			*GT code -- provides functionality?  not entirely...
			*Tera-term -- weird liscence... no colors ;).  SSH is an add-on DLL!  oooh.
			*Putty...?  Yanking it out?  Converting?  dave doesn't know... but he's hopeful (last hope??)
			*Plink?
		~Prof Program!

>>What to look for in next meeting:
	*Dave: GT code providing functionality
	     : Putty fixups
	*Mark: Save file dialogue?
	*Ben : Get a professor program running!!  Debugger>> it MUST be working when they're ready for it.

>>What's up?
	-Succesful presentation!
	-Mark's gone through the G-Term code
		--History will be considered "not doable" until terminal is working
		--if customer asks?  We can't lead him on; we should tell him.  Hold off until Mark's worked it.
	-Design issues:
		--networking ASYNC: when is an event is thrown?  on arrival of character or completion of line?
		--so how would GDB connect?  Dave hands me a pointer to a plink session.
		--the commands being sent are identical between local/remote...
		--the difference is a pointer in my program to a wxProcess that Mark could pass me

		--debugger: new insantiation every time debugger is begun
		--should the debugger be aware of local/remote?
		--Dave is now saying it should & I get a pointer to a network object
		--back to events!

		--How are events handled?
		--when we have a lot of output comming through the buffer, who's holding it?
		--gdb launches the other program in a seperate window... how do we get that output?
>>For nExT wEeK
	-no history for term?
	-local/remote option with locations of important programs
	-GDB: more research
	-network:

	--VNC demo
	--GDB handles output for [a.out] on the command line!  but that means I need to parse it more...
	--better check this with John & Jeremiah
	--so design issue: Dave throws an event, I catch, and parse.  I send command to Dave.

>>Status Report!
	~Mark: tweeks with the editor, new buttons, more commits... 65% done?
	~Dave: REAL productive weekend... but now it's broken...  Something about deleting null pointers.  Re-wrote the events & now it won't compile.  Before it was working AWESOME!! Sending all the events correctly!  And then... oops.  x_x  Tried to figure out why it crashed on exit.
	~Ben: majority of debugger code is there!  time to debug  ^_^
>>Needs for Mark:
	~For buttons>> details about what to hook up & what return types
>>Project Discussion
	~it's all in the GUI (code?)
	~better to have a seperate class
>>Misc. Discussion...
	-user manual: Mark's use cases (yay!).
	-local/remote: which is default?? what happens if remote isn't an option?  meeting with the customer!
	-local/remote: on newfile, how do we ask?
	-local/remote: i have a remote file open, i click a toggle button to switch mode... what happens?
	-local/remote: expanding the fileMenu with "Save Local".."Save Remote".."Open Local"..
	-local/remote: adding an open button (local / remote).  CLicking "Save" brings up a small dialoge: "Local / Remote?"
	-parser: problem with remote parsing of files... it looks for all libraries.  how can we manage this remotely??
	-parser: caching?  saving local copy of requested file?
	-parser: research into converitng into C over break
	-debugger: change from wxProcess -> wxProcess2.  Dave has code for me??
>>Mark's Patch to wxWindows  (0.0)
	-we'll have to update & re-compile our wxWindows build (soon to be wxWidgets?)
>>Friday discussion between Mark & Dave & networking...
>>wxProcess2() is what we need for debugger...
>>This week....
	-Dave: wxProcess2().  Expect thursday for somewhat workable code to assimulate into debug.  3 stage compiling?  1= they type in terminal.  2= insert compile stuff into terminal.  3=background
	-Mark: Project management
	-Ben: test debugger with what he's got

>>Status!
	~Ben's been slacking.  :(  Still with Dave's new code I need to re-adjust my code.  oh, permissions is updated.
	~Mark?  not as much progress as he'd like...
	~Dave?  Got ASYNC working (wow).  Attempted wxSSH, one compile error...
>>Project Management?
	-Dave's ideas... he smells "it" comming... what are we allowing user to do, what can we do
	-What is a project?  A collection of files that go together & compile at once.
	-Allow user to open a workspace, close, & compile.  Ability to include EZ-Windows Library...
	-Items:
	1) storing items local / absolute?  So when compiler gets files, absolute paths are needed.
	2) Mark wants to store them relative
	3) Issue of mixed projects
	Use cases:
		P1) User has a remote project open, wants to save locally...
		S1) He see's "Open Project" and "Close/Save Project"... no custom save spots

		P2) User closes a project...
		S2) Windows with files stay open.  Project file closes.  -OR- Pop up a dialogue for Y/N to close all docs

		S3) When project attributes modified, project configuration saved (not to disk).

		P4) Project is modified... do we update every mod on the server?
		S4) Save-to-disc project files when project is closed.

		P5) User opens a new project / User creates new project (project is open currently)
		S5) Ask user with dialoge if he/she wants to close current project (Yes / Cancel)

		P6) User wants to compile a project, but 2 files have "int main()"
		P6) Add "compile / no compile" attributes to files being added.  DEFAULT: compile

		S7) Dave doesn't need header files... so Mark will add a section of "compile these" files

		~~discussion on compiling and clicking lines & re-focusing... where the output goes, etc~~
>>Due date...
	-what does Shomper want MINIMUM...?
	-need to meet with him
	-auto-completion (gonna make it work only for local...)?  We'd like to drop this (unexpected complexity, lack of time, impracticality...)
	-meeting with Shomper Tuesday at NOON (need e-mail)
>>Due STuff
	-Ben: Debugger!  duh!
	-User Manual -=-
		Dave does Compiler, Networking
		ben does debugging & perm
		Mark does project, gui, editor
		Tutorial?

>Question of Default Mode: Shomper says remote is to be the default mode
>we want to roll-back the code completion feature.  Shompher: that's fine
>Major functionality as a minimum:
	-"Major Features" -> GUI, debugger, editor, networking, compiler
	-Shomper wants each of these functional.
	-The debugger would be a wonderful addition; it's not "neccesary" but it'd be nice...
	**2nd Presentation**:
		~create a new file, save, compile in terminal, re-write, re-save, re-compile for demo
		~demonstration of a project?
>Feedback
	+our group is most interactive & responsive
	+we seem to work well as a team
	+we're organized (so it seems...)
	+group contribution is high
	-Ben's seperate from the main group... sorta... this confused me when i took notes
>Demonstration of terminal?  It's all good.
>Thoughts on permissions:
	-add a label with current authorization code in CHAMELEON
	-add a reverse-authorize ability in PROFESSOR PROGRAM

>>Status:
	*Ben: ~waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh~  :(  Debugger class overhawl #3
	*Dave: filename stuff.
	*Mark: ~zzz~  oh, code!  YEAH!
>>Discussion
	*modified files: who knows?  What get sent to Debugger?
	*Project: when do we need to know if a file in a project has been modified?
	*Debugger & Adv. Compilation needs to know.

	*So why don't we gray out Debug button & Run button when a file has been modified (any file)

	*When compiled, compiler needs to be able to get path/filename of executable so mark can send me it.
	*
>>Presentation?  Hopefully we can demo Debugger a bit... depends on how well Mark & I work.
>>TODO:
	*Debugger (duh)
	*Beta: Feature Release #1
	*Tues: Presentation
	*ADV Compilation. (when local & project compilation are done, local dir. cache, then...)
	*Mark: Printing?  Eh... we'll see...

>>Status:
	*Mark: Save As... Remote should work now. / Added flush-config in options dialogue / GUI updated for Debugger!
	*Dave: Network security... check with Dr. Shomper?  Plink connect -> re-working, progress, still a ways off. / Async progress? Eta- 1.5 hrs.  Adv. Compiling?  THURSDAY is set
	*Ben: itching over the REST of my homework... and finances... and debugger finishing (APRIL?!).  What classes does he [Shomper] use??  Figure out what primitives he would like to see.  TODO: custom function, user input / output?

>>TODO:
	*Ben: fix breakpoints, watching variables, user input / output, perfect code, test code.
	*Dave: Thursday, Adv compiling and async networking
	*Mark: if he's bored... printing, then the other random functions (pulling out SSH)

>>Status>
	*Mark: Working on ... ?
	*Dave: Not a lot of progress... upset that it's not done.  Muddled in design ideas.
	*Ben: minimal coding.

>>Issues: (breakpoints)
	*need to document SOMEWHERE that we can't get GDB to spit out a path for breakpoints...
	*the limit = identical file names in one compiled file, different paths, cannot be differentiated

	*GDB doesn't accept tildes in file paths
	*solution?  getting home directory, avoid tilde?

>>Things this week:
	*Project code has been re-hashed.
	*Projects are stored absolute. (??)
	*Next Thursday: Maint. Manual DUE  So we need to do something about it
	*BETA: Handed to Ben Next Saturday for playing
		-->printing
		-->breakpoints (variable watching??)
		-->?2.5?

>>Maintenance Manual:
	*Doxigen for our code.
	*Detail issue: *see requirements*
	*Latest: start it tuesday in class

>>Design:
	*issues with remote/local networking pointer sending
	*Debugger needs a re-design in [start()]
	*Dave may have found a round-about...he'll have to tell Debugger since

>>By Sunday:
	--dave: reworking networking
	--mark: ??
	--ben: Variable watching functional (??), breakpoints DONE & over, GDB custom view / send function?
