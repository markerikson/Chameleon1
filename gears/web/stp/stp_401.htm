<h1>4.0 Test Cases</h1>

<p><em>Simply state that this section lists all of the test
cases.</em></p>

<p><em>When writing each test case, assume that the reader
(tester) is a customer. This means that the customer will only
know about the whole product, not individual modules (i.e. don't
say things like "the GUI module will pass an intermediate file to
the Engine.DLL", because the customer has no clue what GUI or
Engine means, nor this intermediate file). Also be sure that if
you need to use a certain file for a test case, then that file
needs to be prepared ahead of time (store it in the "tests"
subdirectory), and the test case needs to explicitly direct the
reader to load this file.<br>
 --JC.</em></p>

<h2>4.n Test Case n</h2>

<h3>4.n.1 Purpose</h3>

<em>Describe the purpose of this test case. Usually this includes
some mention of either verifying a requirement and/or ensuring
that a given logic path is traversed.<br>
 --JC.</em> 

<h3>4.n.2 SRS Requirement</h3>

<em>Describe the SRS requirement for this test case. Provide a
hyperlink to the specific SRS requirement.<br>
 --JC.</em> 

<h3>4.n.3 Environmental Needs</h3>

<em>Describe any and all environmental needs for this test case
(e.g. Internet connection, operating system, printer connection,
etc.).<br>
 --JC.</em> 

<h3>4.n.4 Inter-case dependencies</h3>

<em>Describe any and all inter-case dependencies for this test
case (e.g. test case 4.6 will only work if test case 4.2 was
successful). It might be helpful to provide a hyperlink to any
dependent test cases.<br>
 --JC.</em> 

<h3>4.n.5 Special Procedure Requirements</h3>

<em>Describe any and all special procedure requirements for this
test case (e.g. before running this test case, may need to
manually edit some input file to inject an error to test error
handling, etc.).</em>
<p><em>For example, if a specific file used in this test case
needs to be copied from your "stp/tests" subdirectory to the
"C:\TEMP" directory on the tester's machine, then explain that
here like this:<br>
 --JC.</em></p>

<p>Copy the file <a href="tests/test01.txt">test01.txt</a> to
"C:\TEMP\TEST01.TXT".</p>

Sometimes this section is not applicable, but it is provided here
in case you need it. <br>
--JC.  

<h3>4.n.6 Procedural Steps</h3>

 <em>In painstaking detail describe the procedural steps that a
user must do to perform this test case. Write the instructions
assuming that the tester is a customer and knows nothing about
internal data files, DLL interaction, or any other
developer-known secrets. Here's an example:<br>
 --JC.</em> 

<ol>
<li>If the application is currently running, close it.</li>

<li>Invoke the application.</li>

<li>Open an existing data file for the application to use (e.g.
go to File | Open). In the Open File dialog box navigate to the
file named "C:\TEMP\TEST01.TXT" and click the Open button. 

<p><b>Expected Results:</b> Before continuing this test case,
verify that the application loads the specified data file
successfully. (If it fails to load properly, a warning message
would be displayed.)</p>
</li>

<li>Validate the loaded data file (e.g. go to Tools | Validate). 

<p><b>Expected Results:</b> Before continuing this test case,
verify that the application displays a message box that looks
like this:<br>
 <img alt="test01.gif" src="../images/img01.gif"></p>
</li>

<li>Click the OK button to dismiss the message box.</li>

<li>Exit the application (e.g. go to File | Exit).</li>
</ol>

<h3>4.n.7 Pass/Fail Criteria</h3>

<em>Normally you would say that if the expected results match the
actual results, then the test case passes; otherwise it
fails.<br>
 --JC.</em>
