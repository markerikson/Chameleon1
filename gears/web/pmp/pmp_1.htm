<h1>1.0 Introduction</h1>
<h2><a name="overview">1.1 Project Overview</a></h2>
<em></em>This
document describes the management processes for Digital Gearheads'
senior design project, an adaptable IDE codenamed "Chameleon". The
project's main objectives are to learn about software engineering
techniques and ultimately produce a working program usable by introductory
programming students. There are several milestones for this project. By
November 20, a basic rough version of Chameleon should exist. By the beginning
of 2004, a "beta" version will be released for testing.  From there on, each 
two-week iteration will end in a release.&nbsp; At the end of the spring
semester, Chameleon should be complete.&nbsp; Our resources are Mark's
all-nighters, Ben's cunning, Dave's Linux server, and a Holocaust
cloak.&nbsp; Our budget is 42 cents.<br>

<p>Chameleon's details can be seen in the Software Requirements Specification document.</p>

<h2><a name="deliverables">1.2 Project Deliverables</a></h2>
Deliverables for the Chameleon project include the documentation
(the Software Configuration Management Plan, the Project Management
Plan, the Software Requirements Specification, and the Software Design
Document), the software source code, program executables, and useful
notes taken/recorded per team member.<br>

<br>

<h2><a name="evolution">1.3 Evolution of the PMP</a></h2>
This document will be reviewed as needed during team meetings and 
updated as necessary.&nbsp; Project requirements will be updated 
through discussion with the customer as progress is made.&nbsp; 
The project schedule will be updated after discussion at team meetings.<br>
