<h1>1.0 Introduction</h1>









<h2><a name="overview">1.1 Project Overview</a></h2>
<em></em>This
document describes the management processes for Digital Gearheads'
senior design project, an adaptable IDE codenamed "Chameleon". The
project's main objectives are to learn about software engineering
techniques and ultimately produce a working program usable by beginning
programming students. There are several milestones for this project. By
November 20, a basic rough version of Chameleon should exist. Further
major milestones, such as the end of the fall semester, will be worked
out as project progress becomes clearer. In between, each two-week
iteration will end in a release.&nbsp; At the end of the spring
semester, Chameleon should be complete.&nbsp; Our resources are Mark's
all-nighters, Ben's cunning, Dave's Linux server, and a Holocaust
cloak.&nbsp; Our budget is about 42 cents.<br>

<p>Chameleon's details can be seen in the Software Requirements Specification document.

<h2><a name="deliverables">1.2 Project Deliverables</a></h2>









<em>
</em>Deliverables for the Chameleon project include the documentation
(the Software Configuration Management Plan, the Project Management
Plan, the Software Requirements Specification, and the Software Design
Document), the software source code, program executables, and whatever
actual program documentation or tutorials that is decided upon later.<br>
