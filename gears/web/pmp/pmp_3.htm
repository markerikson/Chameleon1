<h1>3.0 Managerial Process</h1>

 <h2><a name="mgmt">3.1 Management Objectives and Priorities</a></h2>
  <p>The team's main managerial goal is to minimize management overhead for the Chameleon project.&nbsp; Overhead such as scheduling, task tracking, and customer relations.&nbsp; Our ultimate goal, of course, is to provide a completed product by the end of the 2003-2004 school year.</p>

 <h2><a name="assumptions">3.2 Assumptions, Dependencies, and Constraints</a></h2>
  <p>The team is constrained by the fact that we are all students, there are only three of us on the team, and our lack of project experience.</p>

 <h2><a name="risks">3.3 Risk Management</a></h2>
  <p>We plan to have two weekly meetings: a 1-hour meeting on Thursdays for serious project discussion, and a quick 15-minute meeting on Sundays for brief status updates.&nbsp; If necessary, we may alter our initial meeting plans to handle further discussion.&nbsp; The meetings will help us stay on top of project issues as they arise.
  <p>Meetings and other discussions will handle problems such as miscommunication.&nbsp; Should we run into technical difficulties or a task we've underestimated, we will most likely delay the relevant feature until actually completed.&nbsp; Changes in requirements will be handled by going through the Feature Driven Development process.</p>

 <h2><a name="monitor">3.4 Monitoring and Controlling Mechanisms</a></h2>
  <p>The dotProject management application lets us enter details on tasks, then provides a list of tasks and their current completed percentage as updated by us.&nbsp; It can also produce Gantt charts from that list of tasks, which will give us a visual representation of our schedule.&nbsp;</p>
