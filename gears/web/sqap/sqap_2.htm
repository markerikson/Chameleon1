<h1>2.0 Management</h1>

<h2><a name="org">2.1 Organization</a></h2>

<em>In the real world, the SQA organization is separate from the
development organization. Only product management is the
organization that is over the SQA and Development organizations.
Since we do not have a separate SQA group in the class, you need
to state this deviation from the industry standard. As an
alternative to the traditional organizational structure, explain
that your team will implement QA practicies by each team member.
You may want to say that a team vote will be used in places where
quality decisions need to out-weigh development schedule
decisions.<br>
 --JC.</em> 

<h2><a name="tasks">2.2 Tasks and Responsibilities</a></h2>

<em>Describe the portion of the software life cycle covered by
the SQAP. Describe the SQA tasks and their sequence.</em>
<p><em>For example, when the RP is being developed, one SQA task
is to ensure that it is as complete as possible for the customer
to understand the proposed functionality of the product. Your
job, as SQA, is to keep refining the RP until the customer is
satisfied. If time runs out for this activity (i.e. you couldn't
finish the RP in time), then the quality of this deliverable is
probably less than optimal.</em></p>

<p><em>Another example is for the Specification phase of the
software life cycle. At the end of this phase the SRS is
produced. Due to the great importance for accuracy and
completeness in this document, a Peer Review will be conducted.
Each team member (and the instructor) will spend a week
inspecting the product, recording all noticeable defects. At the
peer review meeting, all defects will be reported and recorded.
The moderator will assign a team member to close each outstanding
item. This is all done to promote and improve the quality of this
document.</em></p>

<p><em>When the implementation phase begins (CS525), we will do
some code reviews also.</em></p>

<p><em>When the system testing begins (CS525), each build will be
tested by the team members and test engineers. This testing
activity is yet another task done during a software life cycle
phase to promote and improve quality.</em></p>

<p><em>For each phase, try to identify tasks and responsibilities
that will affect the quality of the product.<br>
 --JC.</em></p>
