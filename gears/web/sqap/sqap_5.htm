<h1>5.0 Reviews and Audits</h1>

<h2><a name="purpose">5.1 Purpose</a></h2>

<em>Anybody can say, "the quality of our team's SRS is
sufficient," but how could an un-biased independent evaluator
draw the same conclusion? Answer: By using the same standard to
measure the item. The standards discussed in section 4, are used
during reviews and audits to determine if the product does in
fact posses sufficient quality. The purpose of section 5 of the
SQAP is to explain how and when various reviews and audits will
be done to measure a product's quality.<br>
 --JC.</em> 

<h2><a name="min">5.2 Minimum Requirements</a></h2>

<em>For each item listed in section 3.2, list when and by whom
the item's quality will be assessed. You also need to identify
which standards (from section 4.2) will be used to assess this
quality.</em>
<p><em>For example, the SRS will have an internal audit among the
team members to be sure that the document looks ready for the
peer review. This internal audit use the documentation standards,
as well as the instructions written in the SRS templates, to
determine if the SRS is ready for distribution and review. After
that, the SRS will go through a formal Ispection by each team
member, including the instructor. The Requirements checklist
provided by Steve McConnell will be used as a guideline. At the
end of this formal inspection, there will be a formal meeting for
all the team reviewers to discuss all defects found. The results
of the inspection meeting will be followed up by the Moderator to
ensure that every action item got closed.</em></p>

<p><em>That's just for the SRS. Think about all the other items
and how they will be reviewed and audited.<br>
 --JC.</em></p>

<h2><a name="other">5.3 Other</a></h2>

<em>As mentioned previously, the items listed in section 3.3 do
not directly affect the end product's quality. However, these
items do need to be reviewed and audited. Explain when that gets
done, who does it, and what standards are used to determine if
the items pass the review/audit.</em>
<p><em>For example, someone may collect status and update the
Gantt chart for the week. However, a different person on the team
will examine the latest Gantt chart to determine if a resonable
amount of normal progress has been made this week. If it looks
like the project is falling behind, then the Gantt chart may be
in error, or the Gantt chart may be accurately reporting that the
project really is falling behind. This is the kind of things that
you want to discuss in this section.<br>
