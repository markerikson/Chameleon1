<h1>3.0 Documentation</h1>

<h2><a name="purpose">3.1 Purpose</a></h2>

<em>Briefly, the purpose of this documentation section of the
SQAP is to identify the documents that will be written for the
project. You need to distinguish between those documents that
directly affect the quality of the end product and those that do
not. Such documents (and their quality attributes) are items that
need to be discussed here, in section 3 of the SQAP.<br>
 --JC.</em> 

<h2><a name="min">3.2 Minimum Documentation Requirements</a></h2>

<em>For this section, you need to identify the documentation
related to development, verification, validation, use, and
maintenance of the software. You also need to specify how
documents are to be checked for adequacy, including the criteria
to be applied and the related review or audit.</em>
<p><em>How do you do that? Well, first start with the list of
documentation. Not all of the documents that you write for this
project will be directly related to product quality. Those
documents that DO affect the product quality get included in this
section (3.2). Those other documents that do NOT affect the
product quality get included in the next section (3.3). I would
suggest that you consider at least the SQAP, SRS, SDD, Source
Code, PPRs, STP, and the SUM as the documents with the most
influence on the quality of your product.</em></p>

<p><em>Using that list, you then need to explain how you
determine if the quality of each item is adequate. The way they
are checked for adequacy is by having one (or more) persons on
your team review the documentation written by somebody else. The
general idea is that an extra set of eyes helps to find mistakes,
and that each person tends to be blind to some of their own
mistakes. Another quality check point is provided by the
instructor. The instructor will also review the product
documentation, providing feedback about sections that need to be
improved. Another important thing to mention is that for the SRS,
SDD, source code, and the STP, there will be formal inspection
meetings (peer reviews). These activities are really key to
promoting and improving quality in the product!<br>
 --JC.</em></p>

<h2><a name="other">3.3 Other</a></h2>

<em>This section is just to identify all the other documents
included in this project, which are not necessarily required to
promote the quality of the product. Please don't think that these
other documents are useless--on the contrary; they're very
important. It's just that their purpose may not be primarily
related to the quality of the product. For example, the weekly
status reports are probably more related to schedule than
quality. Another example might be the PMP, which deals more with
schedule and costs, than quality.<br>
