<h1>6.0 Problem Reporting and Corrective Action</h1>

<em>When errors are found in your work products, how will your
team resolve them? Most teams feel that every person on the team
is empowered to make any and all changes they feel are necessary
to the products. However, occasionaly a person feels that
somebody changed their work, making the product worse rather than
better. When this happens, then perhaps a discussion with the
whole team is in order. If that's the model your team plans to
adopt, then so state.</em>
<p><em>Other teams would like to have one person solely
responsible for all changes that occur to a given product. When
using this model, if a teammate finds an error in a product, then
the normal process is to send an e-mail to the product owner
describing the suggested improvement. It is then up to the
product owner to decide if the suggestion improves the product or
not.</em></p>

<p><em>There are other methods that can be used--ranging from
very informal to highly formal. You need to explain the process
that your team will use for reporting, tracking, and resolving
problems in the product and the process.</em></p>

<p><em>Note that when we finally start doing software builds in
CS525, then we will use PPRs to report problems with the
software. Be sure to explain the <a href="../spr/spr.htm">Problem
Tracking Process</a> used by PPRs in this section of the
SQAP.<br>
