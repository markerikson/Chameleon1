<h1>4.0 Standards, Practices, Conventions, and Metrics</h1>

<h2><a name="purpose">4.1 Purpose</a></h2>

<em>To measure anything, you need an approved standard to which
the item is compared. Quality is no different. The purpose of
section 4 in the SQAP is to describe those standards, practices,
conventions, and metrics that will be used to measure your
product's quality. That way you can see if the product satisfies
its quality objectives, or if more work needs to be done.<br>
 --JC.</em> 

<h2><a name="content">4.2 Content</a></h2>

<em>Here is where you provide the complete list. For each list
item, state how compliance will be monitored and assured.</em>
<p><em>For example, you may need to say that your Documentation
Standards are as follows:... and then actually describe the
standards (e.g. all documentation needs to be spell checked,
grammar checked, conforms to HTML level 4.0, all the hyper links
need to be valid, etc.).</em></p>

<p><em>You will also need some Coding Standards. I suggest that
you look at the <b>Code Complete</b> textbook to get good ideas
for this. Consider such things as: a standard indentation level
of 3 spaces; comments written at the level of intent (the why,
not the how); each file shall have a header block that lists the
name, purpose, and modification history of the file; the use and
creation of global data discouraged; variable names need to
accurately and completely describe the purpose; what is the
recommended length of a routine?; what is the recommended length
of a routine name?; what is the recommended length of a variable
name?; what is the recommended length of a file?; what is the
recommended length of a file name?; what is the recommended
length of a source code line?; dicuss coupling and cohesion;
etc.</em></p>

<p><em>You will also need to discuss your Testing Standards.
Define and address the importance of things like unit testing,
module testing, path testing, integration testing, system
testing, qualification testing, etc. When will you do these? Will
you do all of them? How will you know if they get done or not? Be
sure that what you write in this section answers such
questions.</em></p>

<p><em>One of the metrics you may use is the number of items
reported at the inspection meetings. Another metric might be the
total amount of time (for all reviewers) that was spent reviewing
the product. When you enter the incremental build cycle next
quarter, you may use PPRs as a form of metrics. Try to think
about other metrics that you may need to collect that help
measure and assess the quality of the products.<br>
