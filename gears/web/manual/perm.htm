<h1>X.0 Permissions Module</h1>

  <h2 class=aindent><a name="description">Description:</a></h2>
  <p class=pindent>The Permissions module couples with the Professor program as being one of the prime reasons this IDE is named Chameleon.  This module, when coupled with a number generated from the Professor Program, enables ('shows') or disables ('hides') various features of the Chameleon IDE.  This module is also dual-layered.  When you type in an authorization code, things are not automatically "shown".  Instead, you are given the items your professor enabled, and they are listed with a checkbox (layer one).  To show them, make sure the checkbox has a check in it, and click "OK" and the item will appear (layer two).  Otherwise they will remain hidden.</p>

  <h2 class=aindent><a name="Purpose">Purpose:</a></h2>
  <p class=pindent>The purpose of this module is to allow the professor to hide the daunting advanced features of an IDE from novice programmers.</p>

  <h2 class=aindent><a name="Example">Example:</a></h2>
  <p class=pindent>Suppose you're a programmer in your first programming class.  You've just been told what an IDE is, and you know some basic coding.  You know nothing of compiling, debugging, projects... anything of that sort yet.  Your professor knows this.  He uses the Professor Program and gives the class a particular number to type into Chameleon.  Once the number is in, everything strange goes away and you're left with a simple screen, some line numbers, and a terminal.  That's what the Permission Module is for.</p>
  <p class=pindent>Now consider that you've had your fun with programming and compiling in a small terminal window, and you want more.  The professor gives you a new number, which you type in.  Now you have a compile button, debugger buttons, syntax highlighting... the works.  But your classmate Rhonda still needs help with the basics.  Her code looks like yours, but Chameleon for her remains at a basic text editor and terminal window.  This is also what the Permissions Module is for.</p>
