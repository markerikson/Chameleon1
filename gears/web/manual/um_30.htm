<h1>3.0 Network Connectivity</h1>
 <p>Chameleon provides you with a Network Transparent environment that allows for development and testing of code on the computer infront of you and on a remote server without the user having to know about the difference.</p>
 <h2><a name="mode">3.1 Remote vs Local</a></h2>
  <p>A remote file is a file that is stored on a remote server.  A local file is a file that is stored on the computer in front of you.</p>
  <p>All actions have equivalent local and remote abilities.  The controls are the same, so your interaction is irrelevant of locality.</p>
  <p>Most menu and toolbar actions are preformed on the file currently being edited.  If the current visible file is a local file, compliation, debugging, and execution will be run locally.  If the current visible file is a remote file, compliation, debugging, and exection will be run on the remote server.</p>

 <h2><a name="connect">3.2 How to connect.</a></h2>
  <p>Opening or saving to remote files can be accomplished through the appropriate menu commands, after a correct username, hostname, and password have been entered in the options menu.</p>
  <p>Opening local files can be accomplished whenever, if you have the proper permission to do so.</p>
