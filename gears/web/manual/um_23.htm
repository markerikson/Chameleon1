<h1>2.0 User Interface</h1>
	<h2><a name="menus">2.3 Options Dialog</a></h2>

<p>
Chameleon has a variety of options that can be changed to suit your preferences.  In addition, the Options dialog is where you can see what features have been activated by your professor.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<div class="indent">
	<p>
	<b>Current authorized features</b>
	<br>
	All currently authorized features are listed here.  When new features are authorized, they will not be checked.  You need to check a feature to enable it once it is authorized.
	</p>
	<p></p>
	<b>Authorization code</b>
	<br>
	Your professor will periodically give you a new authorization code.  When he does, paste or type the code into the text box in this tab, then click the <i>Set Authorization Code</i> button.  This will update the list of authorized features in the box on the left side.
	</p>
</div>
<h3>Network</h3>	
<div class="indent">
	<p>
	<b>Remote server information</b>
	<br>
	Chameleon has the ability to open files that are on a remote server, as well as create a command-line connection to that server.  The Network tab lets you fill in the information for the server you wish to connect to.  Please note that passwords cannot contain double-quote marks, and that the same password must be typed into both password fields for verification.  Also, Chameleon currently does not save your password between sessions.  This means you will need to return to the options menu and type in your password each time you run Chameleon.
	</p>
</div>
<h3>Compiler</h3>
<div class="indent">
	<p>
	<b>Compiler settings</b>
	<br>
	Chameleon has the ability to compile either individual files or groups of files ("projects") on either the local computer or on the remote server.  However, Chameleon needs to know where several programs are located on the local system.  These should be filled in by default, but you can change them if necessary.
	</p>	
</div>
<h3>Styles</h3>
<div class="indent">
	<p>
	<b>Syntax Highlighting</b>
	<br>
	Chameleon has the ability to "syntax highlight" your code, which means it can color different parts of the text.  Portions that can be colored include C++ keywords, numbers, strings, comments, curly braces, math operators, and more.  Each of these can be set to a different color, font, and size.  All of that can be done on this tab.
