<h1>5.0 Software Design</h1>

<h2><a name="overview">5.1 Overview</a></h2>

<em>Provide a couple sentences or paragraphs describing the
overview of the software design.<br>
 --JC.</em> 

<h2><a name="architecture">5.2 Architecture</a></h2>

<h3>5.2.1 System Architectural Components</h3>

<em>I'm looking for an architectural diagram that shows the major
top-level components for the project. Typically, there might be
about 5 +/- 2 shown here, but not more than 10. Be sure to keep
the diagram simple, minimizing connection lines drawn between the
components (typically those connection lines indicate
communication coupling). Quite often the most common top-level
architectural components designed by students are (1) the
graphical user interface, (2) some kind of a computation engine,
(3) maybe another computation engine, and sometimes (4) some kind
of HTML output report generator.<br>
 --JC.</em> 

<h3>5.2.2 Modules in Components</h3>

<em>I'm looking for a list of all the modules (or classes) that
comprise each high-level architectural component. Please note
that there may be anywhere from one to many modules that comprise
one of the high-level architectural components. Be sure that all
of the modules are listed here (number each one), categorizing
them according to the components that they make up. Each one of
these modules will be listed and described in great detail later
in section 5.9. Here's a little example, based on the "SumDiv"
sample project I have available that demonstrates how to build a
project using VB and C++:<br>
 --JC.</em> 

<p>Architectural Component #1:<br>
<b>SumDiv Calculator Engine (C-based DLL)</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Initialization module (e.g. DLL main)</li>

<li>Addition module</li>

<li>Division module</li>
</ol>

<p>Architectural Component #2:<br>
<b>SumDiv Graphical User Interface (VB-based EXE)</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Initialization class (e.g. form load, etc.)</li>

<li>LHS Value (text box class)</li>

<li>RHS Value (text box class)</li>

<li>Addition Command (command button class)</li>

<li>Division Command (command button class)</li>

<li>Results Value (text box class)</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="constraints">5.3 Design Constraints</a></h2>

<em>List any design constraints or assumptions that your design
will be based on.<br>
 --JC.</em> 

<h2><a name="global">5.4 Global Data Objects</a></h2>

<em>List any global variables that will be designed into your
system (hopefully there wont be any). Be sure to explain why
these global data objects are designed to be global. A common
(but poor) example of this is project that has hard-coded output
file names that the user cannot dictate at run-time. Somewhere
within the project is a global variable or constant that
specifies this file name.<br>
 --JC.</em> 

<h2><a name="errors">5.5 Error Handling</a></h2>

<em>Explain how you plan to handle internal, user, and system
errors. For example, if you have internal errors, will the assert
macro be used liberally throughout your source code to detect
such an item? Or if the user enters invalid data, do you have a
consistent and user-friendly way to handle this for all cases? If
your application is running and some part of the system goes down
(e.g. the user pressed Ctl-Alt-Del), do you have a way to recover
the work-in-progress file(s) from such an abrupt abort? Discuss
these and any other related items in this section.<br>
 --JC.</em> 

<h2><a name="language">5.6 Development Language</a></h2>

<em>Describe the language that will be used for development of
the software. For example, is it ANSI C, or K&amp;R C, etc. What
brands and versions of compilers and linkers will be used to
ensure consistency?<br>
 --JC.</em> 

<h2><a name="precond">5.7 Preconditions and
Postconditions</a></h2>

<em>List any and all preconditions that must be met prior to
starting your application. For exmaple, if your program relies on
specific databases for initialization, then so state. Does your
application rely on any system DLLs for execution?<br>
 --JC.</em> 

<p><em>Describe any and all postconditions that shall be
guaranteed by the system. For example, if one of your modules
opens a data file for writing, will that same module be
responsible for closing the data file, too? When will such a data
file be closed?<br>
 --JC.</em></p>
