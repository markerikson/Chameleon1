<h1>1.0 Introduction</h1>




<h2><a name="purpose">1.1 Purpose of Document</a></h2>




<p>This document serves as a checkpoint for how we intend to persue design and implementation of our product, the Chameleon Adaptive IDE.  It specifies exact points that the program is intended to work on, how modules interact, what those modules are, and how we intend to code, document, and present them.  This document is the end-all of the design of the product; that is, this document shows how our team, <i>Digital Gearheads</i>, intends to complete the whole working product.
</p>
 

<h2><a name="scope">1.2 Scope</a></h2>




<p>Our product is meant to cater to begginner, novice, and advanced CS students with a working feature-filled IDE.  It is meant to give the professor overseeing such students the ability to limit visible features as to keep students from wandering into undiscovered territory and rendering their project as viable as roadkill on a hot Sunday afternoon.  As such it is meant to give professors control over what a student sees, and the student the ability to code in a comfortable environment, compile, debug, and complete programming projects.</p><p>
This document's scope, as described in the purpose, is to list the specifics on how differing elements within the product interact.  It will cover coding specifics, module specifics, interaction specifics, and visible product specifics.
