<h1>1.0 - Project Background</h1>
<p>See our <a href="../srs/srs.htm">Software Requirement Specifications</a></p>
<h1>2.0 - Project-Related Skills and Knowledge</h1>
<h2>2.1 - GUI / Editor</h2>
<p>The primary area that we had to learn for the GUI was the wxWidgets toolkit (formerly known as wxWindows).  This was primarily an issue for Mark, since he was in charge of the GUI module, but the other team members eventually needed to become familiar with portions of it as well.  While none of us had previously used wxWidgets, Mark's prior experience with other GUI toolkits allowed him to easily transition to wxWidgets.  Some of the important areas of knowledge were general GUI design principles (much of which is learned only through experience), the wxWidgets event model, familiarity with the capabilities of the different wxWidgets classes, and wxWidgets-based "template" datastructure classes.</p>
<p>Creating the program would have been nearly impossible without the numerous available parts, samples, and third-party programs we were able to find and use.  For the GUI, these include:
	<ul>
		<li>The wxWidgets toolkit itself.  Freely available, open-source, and cross-platform.  <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">http://www.wxwidgets.org</a></li>
		<li>Scintilla, a "programmer's text editor" control.  It has built-in syntax highlighting, line numbering, line markers, search and replace, and many more capabilities that we didn't have time to make use of.  Available in wxWidgets as wxStyledTextCtrl.  <a href="http://www.scintilla.org">http://www.scintilla.org</a></li>
		<li>wxTerm, a vt100-capable terminal widget written using wxWidgets.  wxTerm is based off of GTerm, an abstract vt100 translation library.  Originally written for a Telnet client, we were able to modify it for use in Chameleon.  <a href="http://linux.techassocinc.com/projects/tatelnet/">http://linux.techassocinc.com/projects/tatelnet/</a></li>
		<li>wxGuide-Editor, a sample program that demonstrates the use of wxStyledTextCtrl.  Code from wxGuide formed the basis for several key areas of Chameleon, including multiple editors using tabs, printing, and find/replace.  <a href="http://wxguide.sourceforge.net">http://wxguide.sourceforge.net</a></li>
		<li>wxStEdit, another wxStyledTextCtrl-based program.  <a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/~jrl1/wxwindows/wxStEdit/">http://www.lehigh.edu/~jrl1/wxwindows/wxStEdit/</a></li>
		<li>DialogBlocks, a GUI designer for wxWidgets.  While GUI creation using pure code is possible, laying out dialogs using a designer is almost always better.  DialogBlocks proved invaluable for creating Chameleon's dialogs.  <a href="http://www.anthemion.co.uk/dialogblocks/">http://www.anthemion.co.uk/dialogblocks/</a></li>
