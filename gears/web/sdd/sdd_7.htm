<h1>7.0 Packaging</h1>



<h2><a name="doc">7.1 Documentation</a></h2>



<p>Describe what design documentation will be provided in the

final product of this application. For example, will this

document be included on the application's distribution media?<br>

 --JC.<br>
The final package include a user's manual for Chameleon, a tutorial on
its usage, a tutorial and introduction to the Linux environment, and
possibly an introductory reference to the C++ language.<br>
</p> 

<h2><a name="src">7.2 Source Code</a></h2>



<p>Describe what source code (if any) will be provided in the

final package. This helps developers know which source code will

be delivered and which wont. For example, if the rapid prototype

will not be included, then so state. However, if the

application's actual C/C++ source code will be delivered, then so

state. If the source code for the module tests will not be

included, then so state.<br>

 --JC.<br>
The complete source code for Chameleon will be included with the final product.<br>
</p> 

<h2><a name="exe">7.3 Executables</a></h2>



<p>Describe all the exectuable files (listed by name) that will

be included in the final package. Presumably, the application

will be an EXE file and will be included. Will there be any other

EXE files?<br>

 --JC.<br>
The final product will include the main Chameleon executable, along with programs that we use such as <span style="font-style: italic;">plink</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">putty</span>.&nbsp; <br>
</p> 

<h2><a name="data">7.4 Data Files</a></h2>



<p>If your application relies on certain data files that must be

delivered in the final product, then list those files here. For

example, if part of the application needs a database of words,

then explain that this words database will be included.<br>

 --JC.<br>
Chameleon's options will be stored in an INI file located in the same
directory as the main program executable.&nbsp; An INI file will be
included with the final product.<br>
</p> 

<h2><a name="install">7.5 Installation</a></h2>



<p>Discuss the design associated with the installation of the

product. Identify the name of the installation packaging tool.

Discuss how each of the requirements allocated to installation

issues will be implemented in the installation package. For any

requirements listed in the traceability matrix (section 9 of the

SDD), link back to this section of the SDD to identify the

associated design.<br>

 --JC.<br>
The installer for Chameleon has not been worked on yet.&nbsp;
Possibilities for creating an installer include Inno Setup, the
Nullsoft Scriptable Installation System, and the Ghost Installer Free
Edition.<br>
