<h1>7.0 Design Analysis</h1>

<h2><a name="Alt">7.1 Alternatives</a></h2>
  <p>As stated in the PMP, our team is taking a class ownership approach.  As a result, the design details modules is a matter of decision for the designer / coder.  The overall design model, was decided on without much disagreement because of how naturally the partitioning occurs.
  One similar design that was considered had a similar partitioning, but had the GUI as the central communicating entity in the product.  Instead our team has agreed on specific interfaces as listed in section 5 of this document.</p>

<h2><a name="Rat">7.2 Rationale</a></h2>
  <p>The aforementioned alternative was rejected as inefficient due to the amount of communication desired between modules, and the additional complexity that was unnecessary.</p>
