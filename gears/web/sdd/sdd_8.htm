<h1>8.0 Design Analysis</h1>

<h2><a name="Alt">8.1 Alternatives</a></h2>

<p>This section shall list all the design alternatives that your
group has considered, based on the SRS. For example, the SRS may
suggest one particular organization of features and modules, but
your team may consider a different way to design and organize it.
Consider this: The SRS may show one module responsible for
initializing the whole system (which may be fine for the SRS).
However, your design team may consider the alternative to have
each of the independent modules perform its own respective
initialization, rather than depend on some other global module to
do the initializations. Be sure to list any and all design
alternatives that your group may consider. (In the real world,
usually the author of the SRS is not the same person as the
software designer. That's why a SRS may suggest one design
approach, but the design documents (like this one) may use a
totally different one, depending on coding style, execution
efficiency, maintainability, constraints imposed by the
development language, etc.)</p>
<p><p>One significant design alternative that your group may
consider is if the system should be approached using traditional
Structured Design or Object-Oriented Design. Please note that if
your team decides to use the OOD approach for the design
documents (like this one), but traditional structured design was
used for the SRS, then the organization of the modules in this
document may be extremely different from the organization of the
modules in the SRS. For example, in the SRS, each process may
become essentially a module using Structured Design. However,
collections of processes in an SRS may somehow be combined into a
single class (using OOD). Do you consider each class to be
functionally equivalent to the term "module"? If so, then be sure
to describe each member function (routine) that comprises each
module (class), so that all the processes get covered.</p></p>

<p><p>When doing OOD, most people arrive at different designs
for the same type of system. Due to this common variance, please
discuss each team member's candidate classes as design
alternatives.<br>
