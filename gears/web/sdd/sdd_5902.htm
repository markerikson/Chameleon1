<h3><a name="5.9.2">5.9.2</a> SumDiv Graphical User
Interface</h3>

The purpose of the "SumDiv Graphical User Interface" is to
provide the graphical interface for the user. The GUI simply
collects inputs from the user, and depending on the action
selected by the user, calls the processing engine to calculate
the result. The output from the processing engine is then
reflected by the GUI. If the processing engine encounters an
error, then the GUI displays the error information. This AC is to
be implemented as a single form, part of a VB-based Win32 EXE. 

<p>This AC is based on this screen image, as provided by the
Rapid Prototype:<br>
<img src="../images/img50.gif" alt="RPsample"></p>

<p>This AC contains the following modules:</p>

<ol>
<li>Initialization class</li>

<li>LHS Value</li>

<li>RHS Value</li>

<li>Addition Command</li>

<li>Division Command</li>

<li>Results Value</li>
</ol>

The design for each of these modules is specified in the
subsections below.

<h4><a name="5.9.2.1">5.9.2.1</a> Initialization class</h4>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

VB provides a mechanism when a form loads to do certain
initialization processing. The LHS text box is initialized to
5000. The RHS text box is initialized to 1234. The Results text
box is initialized to blank. 

<h5>Interface</h5>

<pre>
Sub Form_Load()
</pre>

<h5>Program Design Language (PDL)</h5>

<pre>
   The Text attribute of the LHS object is set to 5000.
   The Text attribute of the RHS object is set to 1234.
   The Text attribute of the Results object is set to blank.
</pre>

<hr>
<h4><a name="5.9.2.2">5.9.2.2</a> LHS Value</h4>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

The LHS Value is a text box class object provided by VB. The
value stored in this text box is typed in by the user and
represents the Left Hand Side of the equation. For example, in
the case of A + B, the LHS of the + sign is A. In the case of A /
B, the LHS of the / sign is A. This text box stores the value of
A. 

<h5>Interface</h5>

The text box is blanked out. Its name is LHSValue. In the figure
shown above, this is the top text box.

<hr>
<h4><a name="5.9.2.3">5.9.2.3</a> RHS Value</h4>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

The RHS Value is a text box class object provided by VB. The
value stored in this text box is typed in by the user and
represents the Right Hand Side of the equation. For example, in
the case of A + B, the RHS of the + sign is B. In the case of A /
B, the RHS of the / sign is B. This text box stores the value of
B. 

<h5>Interface</h5>

The text box is blanked out. Its name is RHSValue. In the figure
shown above, this is the middle text box. 

<h5>Program Design Language (PDL)</h5>

N/A. 

<hr>
<h4><a name="5.9.2.4">5.9.2.4</a> Addition Command</h4>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

The Addition Command is a command button class object provided by
VB. When the user clicks this command button, the values stored
in the text fields of the LHS Value and the RHS Value are passed
as arguments to the Addition module in the "SumDiv Calculator
Engine" AC. 

<h5>Interface</h5>

The caption on the button says "+". Its name is AddCmd. In the
figure shown above, this is the left command button. 

<h5>Program Design Language (PDL)</h5>

<pre>
    Save as A the value of the Text attribute of the LHSValue.
    Save as B the value of the Text attribute of the RHSValue.

    Call the SumOf fuction in the DLL, passing A and B and
        saving the return value as C.

    Write to the Text attribute of the ResultValue the
  string of C.
</pre>

<hr>
<h4><a name="5.9.2.5">5.9.2.5</a> Division Command</h4>

The Division Command is a command button class object provided by
VB. When the user clicks this command button, the values stored
in the text fields of the LHS Value and the RHS Value are passed
as arguments to the Division module in the "SumDiv Calculator
Engine" AC. 

<h5>Interface</h5>

The caption on the button says "/". Its name is DivCmd. In the
figure shown above, this is the right command button. 

<h5>Program Design Language (PDL)</h5>

<pre>
    Save as A the value of the Text attribute of the LHSValue.
    Save as B the value of the Text attribute of the RHSValue.

    Call the DivBy fuction in the DLL, passing A, B, C, and a text
        array named ErrorMsg that can hold 255 characters.
        Save the return value as a boolean called ReturnStatus.

    If the ReturnStatus from DivBy is true, then
        Write to the Text attribute of the ResultValue the string of C.

    Else the ReturnStatus from DivBy is false, so
        display an exclamation message box, 
        trimming the ErrorMsg string.
</pre>

<hr>
<h4><a name="5.9.2.6">5.9.2.6</a> Results Value</h4>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

The Results Value is a text box class object provided by VB. The
value stored in this text box is read-only, meaning that the user
cannot type something in. This value represents the results of
the calculation. For example, in the case of C = A + B, this box
shows the value of C. 

<h5>Interface</h5>

The text box is blanked out. Its name is ResultValue. In the
figure shown above, this is the bottom text box.
