<h1>5.0 Software Design (Continued)</h1>

<h2>5.9 Module Descriptions (Continued)</h2>

<h3><a name="5.9.1">5.9.1</a> SumDiv Calculator Engine</h3>

<p>The title of this section is the name of the Architectural
Component (AC). Provide a description and purpose of this AC in
this paragraph. This description should also list the lower level
modules that make up this AC. Here's an example:<br>
 --JC.</p> 

<p>The purpose of the "SumDiv Calculator Engine" is to provide
the processing required to perform the addition and division
operations. This AC is to be implemented as a C-based Win32 DLL.
This AC contains the following modules:</p>

<ol>
<li>Initialization module</li>

<li>Addition module</li>

<li>Division module</li>
</ol>

The design for each of these modules is specified below. 

<hr>
<h4><a name="5.9.1.1">5.9.1.1</a> Initialization module</h4>

<p>The title of this section is the name of the module.<br>
 --JC.</p> 

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>Provide a description and purpose of this module. If this
module is a whole C++ class, then talk about the important
behavior (member functions) and state/attributes (member data).
Alternatively, if this module is just a single C function for
instance, then talk about each parameter (or argument) to the
function, as well as its return value. If this module is a VB
class, then talk about only the useful functions and attributes
that you intend to use. Here's an example:<br>
 --JC.</p> 

<p>The Initialization module is named "DllMain" and is a single C
function. This function is called by the Windows operating system
for one of four possible reasons. These reasons are as follows:
(1) when there is a process that attaches to this DLL, (2) when
there is a thread that attaches to this DLL, (3) when there is a
process that detaches from this DLL, and (4) when there is a
thread that detaches from this DLL.</p>

<h5>Interface</h5>

<p>If this module is a Graphical User Interface window, then
display the image here. Alternatively, if this is a function or
class that you must implement, then show the function prototype
or class specification here. This should be EXACTLY how it will
appear in a header file when it comes time for implementation. If
the class or function is provided by a third party (e.g. MFC, VB,
Win32 API, etc.), then simply tell the reader to refer to the
published documentation. Here's an example:<br>
 --JC.</p> 

<p>Here's the interface for this function:</p>

<pre>
BOOL APIENTRY DllMain( HANDLE hModule, 
                       DWORD  ul_reason_for_call, 
                       LPVOID lpReserved
                     );
</pre>

<h5>Program Design Language (PDL)</h5>

<p>Describe the detailed design of this routine by writing the
complete Program Design Language (PDL). (Refer to the McConnell
text for helpful information about writing effective PDL.) Again,
PDL is English statements, formatted and indented to show logic
and control, that describes precisely WHAT to do. When we enter
the implementation phase, you will copy all this PDL, paste it
into your source code files, and then convert it to comments.
This will provide a functional outline for you to implement. Be
sure that your PDL does not contain technical programming
language or notation. PDL should be generic enough to be
implemented in any programming language. Here's an example:<br>
 --JC.</p> 

<p>The PDL for this module is below. Note that nothing is done,
based on the reason for the call. This framework may look useless
for now, but could provide useful structure for later development
and maintenance. It is good style anyway to implement DllMain,
even if the developer has no specific plans to use this
function.</p>

<pre>
{
   Switch on the reason for the call.
   If the reason was for Process-Attach, then do nothing.
   If the reason was for Thread-Attach, then do nothing.
   If the reason was for Process-Detach, then do nothing.
   If the reason was for Thread-Detach, then do nothing.
   Return TRUE to the caller (which is the Operating System).
}
</pre>

<h4><a name="5.9.1.2">5.9.1.2</a> Addition module</h4>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

This module is a single C long function named "SumOf". It takes
in two long integers and returns their sum as a long integer. 

<h5>Interface</h5>

<pre>
CALCFUNC_API long _stdcall SumOf(
    IN const long X,   // input param X (constant)
    IN const long Y    // input param Y (constant)
    )
</pre>

<h5>Program Design Language (PDL)</h5>

<pre>
{
   Return (X+Y) to the caller as the function return value.
}
</pre>

<hr>
<h4><a name="5.9.1.3">5.9.1.3</a> Division module</h4>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

This module is a single C boolean function named "DivBy". This
function takes in two longs X and Y and returns X/Y as a long in
Z. If DivBy() returns TRUE, then it was successful and Z has good
data. If DivBy() returns FALSE, then it was not successful and
the Msg parameter contains a string explaining the reason. 

<h5>Interface</h5>

<pre>
// this is how VB see's a Boolean variable type.
typedef  short  VB_Boolean;  

// max length of a returned Msg[] array.
#define  MAX_MSG_LEN  255    

CALCFUNC_API VB_Boolean _stdcall DivBy(
    IN const long   X,      // input  X (constant)
    IN const long   Y,      // input  Y (constant)
    OUT      long *pZ,      // output ptr to Z
    OUT char Msg[MAX_MSG_LEN] // output message string
    )
</pre>

<h5>Program Design Language (PDL)</h5>

<pre>
{
    If the denominator is zero, then write to the Msg
       the string "Division by zero error caught." and
       return FALSE to the caller.
       
    Else if the denominator is not zero, then calculate
       Z = X / Y
       and update the Z input parameter accordingly.
       Return TRUE to the caller.
}
</pre>
