<h2>Project Legacy Document (postmortem)</h2>
</center>

<hr>
<p><em>You need to prepare an public essay that discusses the
"lessons learned" throughout the creation of the software
engineering project. It should include material on such topics as
group dynamics, personality types (e.g. INTJ), time management,
documentation, design, analysis, requirements, coding, unit
testing, integration testing, configuration management, HTML,
scheduling, productivity tools, Internet, graphics design work,
C++, VB, and any other activities associated with the software
engineering process. Accuracy of content, originality of thought,
and quality of expression are considered in evaluation of the
essay. The document must also include a recommendations section
that advises other engineers about mistakes, errors, or bad
estimates that were made by the team (or individual), steps that
could have/should have been taken to prevent said mistakes, and
any other relevant recommendations for future projects that may
be similar.<br>
