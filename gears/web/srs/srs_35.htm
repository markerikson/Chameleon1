<h2>3.5 Attributes</h2>

This section describes the product's attributes. 

<h3><a name="avail">3.5.1 Availability</a></h3>

The product should be considered always available, though based on environment, specific features may not be.

<h3><a name="secur">3.5.2 Security</a></h3>

No self-security is needed.  The program does however need to be able to communicate with a linux server running SSH2, a form of cryptography.

<h3><a name="maint">3.5.3 Maintainability</a></h3>

The product does not need to be extensible after completion.  Newer features / bug fixes may be added with later release.  No ability for coupling or cohesion is being designed in.

<h3><a name="trans">3.5.4 Transferability/Portability</a></h3>

The product is being designed to work on the Win32 operating system.  In theory, due to the language being used (C++) and the development tools (WXWindows), the product should be portable to other operating systems.  Because there is no direct hardware interaction, the product should be able to be ported to other hardware.
