<h2>3.5 Attributes</h2>

This section describes the product's attributes. 

<h3><a name="avail">3.5.1 Availability</a></h3>

The product should be considered always available, though based on environment, specific features may not be.

<h3><a name="secur">3.5.2 Security</a></h3>

If possible, the feature authorization mechanism should be made somewhat secure.  In addition, the program needs to be able to communicate with a linux server running SSH2, a form of cryptography.

<h3><a name="maint">3.5.3 Maintainability</a></h3>
<p>The program should be designed in a modular fashion to allow for future extension if possible.  Possible extensions may include integration with other projects such as the Debugginator or Virtual Prof, as well as additional features for Chameleon itself.</p>

<h3><a name="trans">3.5.4 Transferability/Portability</a></h3>

The product is being designed to work on the Win32 operating system.  In theory, due to the language being used (C++) and the development tools (WXWindows), the product should be portable to other operating systems.  Efforts should be made to keep code as portable as possible, but not at the expense of functionality.
