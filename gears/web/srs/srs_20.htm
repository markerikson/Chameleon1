<h1>2.0 General Description</h1>

  <h2><a name="perspective">2.1 Product Perspective</a></h2>

    Chameleon is to be, like the animal: adaptable.  The main functionality is that it is to interact as an IDE 
	 with the user.  The IDE's adaptability is its ability to gradually introduce the user to the increasingly 
	 complex features found in modern IDEs such as Microsoft's Visual Studio.  Interaction is accomplished through 
	 use of the keyboard & mouse, as well as the monitor & printer, and may include some network interfacing.  
	 Except for the possibility of expanding to external libraries or programs, this IDE will also interact with 
	 the hard drive and floppy drive, but not with a video card beyond that which is necessary to display things 
	 to the screen.  Interaction with the local network drivers, for example Internet or Ethernet, is required as 
	 functionality will include the ability to communicate with remote servers.

  <h2><a name="functions">2.2 Product Functions and Features</a></h2>

    As mentioned in part 1 of this document, the product will present all of the functionality of a generic IDE, as well as certain abilities designed specifically for the project.  These features include:
      <ul>
        <li>A Master Control program from which the instructor can lock and unlock advanced IDE features such as 
		  advanced debugging tools, class views or windows, terminal access, project access, etc.</li>
        <li>A command-line terminal inside the program for communication with a remote server, most likely 
		  Linux-based..</li>
        <li>Debugging ability from base error detection to advanced step-by-step debugging ability.</li>
        <li>Code syntax completion on-the-fly, completing class or common variable names while the user is typing 
		  them (akin to Micosoft Word's ability to complete the date while typing it).</li>
        <li>Syntax highlighting</li>
        <li>Code block hiding: hide blocks of code down to one descriptive line.</li>
        <li>Project handling on a minor level</li>
      </ul></p>

  <h2><a name="users">2.3 User Characteristics</a></h2>

<p>The expected entry level user (base level of experience) is that of a student with no experience with any IDE.  
The teacher will have the master control switch to limit the functionality of the IDE so that a user new to an IDE 
will not feel overwhelmed with the eyefulls of functionality that a full IDE can contain.  On the other side, power 
users should feel right at home with the IDE being fully able to handle most major programming tasks.  Chameleon 
is expected to cater to brand new users, novice users, moderate users, veteran users, and power users.</p>
<p>Entry level users are just starting to program.  The editor will most likely appear as a simple textbox without 
any coding assistance.  All compilation is done manually by the user using the terminal window.  The IDE allows 
the user to open and save files, along with standard clipboard functions, but no further visual aids are provided.</p>
 <p>A novice user has learned the basics of programming.  Features such as syntax highlighting and debugging are 
 likely to become useful at this stage.  </p>
<p>Moderate users are comfortable with the standard tasks involved in writing a program.  They will most likely be 
ready to begin somewhat larger projects.  Chameleon's project management will allow multiple files and the 
inclusion of outside libraries.  Since the user is now familiar with standard tasks such as compiling, they no 
longer need to be done by hand and can be done with a standard toolbar button instead.</p>
    <p>Advanced users are completely comfortable with most of the aspects of a programming project.  At this point,
	  the user has access to all of Chameleon's available features, such as code folding in the editor.</p>

  <h2><a name="constraints">2.4 General Constraints</a></h2>

<p>Chameleon's main target platform is Windows.  The ability to run under Linux is desired, but as a secondary goal only.  Exact specifications as to disk, RAM, Ethernet, operating system, and other general requirements are unknown.  The best rule-of-thumb, as with all software, is to have the most up-to-date version of operating system possible.  This will take care of minimum disk requirements and memory requirements.</p>

  <h2><a name="assumptions">2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies</a></h2>

This IDE is being provided as is, and it is assumed therefore that the actual ability to program has been communicated by some other means.  The ability to correctly use our software when fully enabled can be inferred from accompanying documentation.  It is also assumed that the program will be interfacing with Linux servers.  This IDE is being presented under the assumption that it is going to be used in an education environment.
