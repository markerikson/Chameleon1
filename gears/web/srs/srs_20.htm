<h1>2.0 General Description</h1>

  <h2><a name="perspective">2.1 Product Perspective</a></h2>

    Chameleon is to be, like the animal: adaptable.  The main functionality is that it is to interact as an IDE with the user.  The adaptability of the IDE is its ability to hide the extraneous or even frightening clutter of advanced IDE features, similar to Microsoft Visual C++.  Interaction is accomplished through use of the keyboard & mouse, as well as the monitor & printer, and may include some network interfacing.  Except for the possibility of expanding to external libraries or programs, this IDE will also interact with the hard drive and floppy drive, but not with a video card beyond that which is necessary to display things to the screen.  Interaction with the local network drivers, for example Internet or Ethernet, is required as functionality will include the ability to communicate with remote servers.
    <p>A summation of information flow can be listed as such:
    <dl>
      <dt><u>Bi-Directional</u></dt>
      <dd><ul>
        <li>External media (floppy drive, hard disk drive)</li>
        <li>Network</li>
      </ul></dd>
      <dt><u>To-User Direction</u></dt>
      <dd><ul>
        <li>Monitor, video card</li>
        <li>Printer</li>

      <dt><u>From-User Direction</u></dt>

  <h2><a name="functions">2.2 Product Functions and Features</a></h2>

    As mentioned in the introduction: scope, this product will present all of the functionality of a generic IDE.  This includes in its most basic scope an editor, compiler, and debugger.  From here Chameleon will add the following functionality:
      <ul>
        <li>Master Control Switch from which the instructor can lock and unlock advanced IDE features such as advanced debugging tools, class views or windows, terminal access, project access, etc.</li>
        <li>Terminal window for communication with the remote servers of the teacher.s choice (currently Linux . based).</li>
        <li>Debugging ability from base error detection to advanced step-by-step debugging ability.</li>
        <li>Code syntax completion on-the-fly, completing class or common variable names while the user is typing them (akin to Micosoft Word's ability to complete the date while typing it).</li>
        <li>Syntax highlighting</li>
        <li>Code block hiding: hide blocks of code down to one descriptive line.</li>
        <li>Project handling on a minor level</li>
      </ul></p>

  <h2><a name="users">2.3 User Characteristics</a></h2>

The expected entry level user (base level of experience) is that of a student with no experience with any IDE.  The teacher will have the master control switch to limit the functionality of the IDE so that a user new to an IDE will not feel overwhelmed with the eyefulls of functionality that a full IDE can contain.  On the other side, power users should feel right at home with the IDE being fully able to handle most major programming tasks.  Chameleon is expected to cater to brand new users, novice users, moderate users, veteran users, and power users.
    <p>The beginner knows how to program, and won't know the difference between a plain text editor and an IDE.  His expectations should be no more than just a text editor.  No debugging functionality is available.
    <p>The novice user will benefit from some code completion, syntax highlighting,  and a debugger.  The full-fledged debugger may be usable, but probably won't be.
    <p>The moderate user wants to be able to begin to explore the multiple file projects.  Chameleon will have some minimal project management, so he will not be disappointed.  Functionality in the debugger is expanded, the ability to hide code is added.
    <p>The power user is a veteran user who demands performance.  Full functionality of the IDE is unleashed to this user.</p>

  <h2><a name="constraints">2.4 General Constraints</a></h2>

So far Chameleon will only be supported on Windows and Linux-based computers.  Exact specifications as to disk, RAM, Ethernet, operating system, and other general requirements are unknown.  The best rule-of-thumb, as with all software, is to have the most up-to-date version of operating system possible.  This will take care of minimum disk requirements and memory requirements.

  <h2><a name="assumptions">2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies</a></h2>

This IDE is being provided as is, and it is assumed therefore that the actual ability to program has been communicated by some other means.  The ability to correctly use our software when fully enabled can be inferred from accompanying documentation.  It is also assumed that the program will be interfacing with Linux servers.  This IDE is being presented under the assumption that it is going to be used in an education environment.
