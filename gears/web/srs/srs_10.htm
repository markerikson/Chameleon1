<h1>1.0 Introduction</h1>

  <h2><a name="purpose">1.1 Purpose of Document</a></h2>

    <p>This document serves as a guideline to the requirements and specifications for the Chameleon Adaptive IDE project.  It describes the tasks the program should accomplish, features it should have, and how it is expected to be used.  This document is still preliminary, and, as a result, is subject to change.</p>

  <h2><a name="scope">1.2 Scope</a></h2>

<p>As suggested by the name "Adaptive IDE", the product will present varying amounts of complexity to the user.  The amount of complexity will be at the overall control of the professor.  The product's major features will include standard IDE features such as compiling, debugging, syntax highlighting, code completion, and some form of project management.  It will also feature a terminal that connects to a remote Linux server.</p>
    <p>Roles with respect to the scope of the project are as follows: Mark will serve as Project and Team Lead; Ben will serve as Requirements Lead and Testing/Quality Assurance Lead; and David will serve as Design Lead and Configuration Manager.</p>
