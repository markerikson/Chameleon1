<h2>3.3 Performance Requirements</h2>

<em>This section describes the performance requirements of Chameleon with regard to Operational Requirements, Exception Handling, and Testing.</em>

<h3><a name="operational">3.3.1 Operational Requirements</a></h3>

<em>Chameleon is an IDE.  As such, there are few operational requitements.  Obviously the GUI will be expected to have reasonable responsiveness.  The network interactions will also not be very demanding.</em>

<h3><a name="exceptions">3.3.2 Exception Handling</a></h3>

<em>The most prevelant exceptions that will be dealt with will be compilation errors, which really are not exceptions.  The most user induced exceptions will deal with file input and output, whether trying to read from inaccessible files, or attempting to write to inaccesible locations.  These exceptions will be reported to the user as soon as they occur allow the user to correct the mistake, and deal with the exception..</em>

<h3><a name="testing">3.3.3 Testing Requirements</a></h3>

<em>Because this product will be cross-platform (Linux and Win32 based), and functional in both a networked environment and a non-networked environment, all four combinations of these will need to be tested.</em>
