<h2>3.3 Performance Requirements</h2>

<p>This section describes the performance requirements of Chameleon with regard to Operational Requirements, Exception Handling, and Testing.</p>

<h3><a name="operational">3.3.1 Operational Requirements</a></h3>

<p>Chameleon is an IDE.  As such, there are few operational requitements.  Obviously the GUI will be expected to have reasonable responsiveness.  The network interactions will also not be very demanding.</p>

<h3><a name="exceptions">3.3.2 Exception Handling</a></h3>

<p>The most prevelant exceptions that will be dealt with will be compilation errors, which really are not exceptions.  The most common user induced exceptions, such as file I/O, division by zero, and array bounding errors will be reported to the user as soon as they occur.  Chameleon will also halt the faulty code and wait for the user to correct the error.  Other exceptions will be dealt with in a similar manner.  Specialized exceptions, like expecting a number and receiving a character, if internal will result in Chameleon quietly and cleanly re-starting itself, but if external (aka code written does not handle this exception) will simply be dependent on the compiler's method of coding it.  As an example, in C++ a character string entered in the place of an integer input stream often resulted in an infinite loop which was terminated by terminating the window.</p>

<h3><a name="testing">3.3.3 Testing Requirements</a></h3>

<p>Because this product will be cross-platform (Linux and Win32 based), and functional in both a networked environment, 2 combinations will need to be tested.  If time allows, a non-networked private release will be tested.</p>
