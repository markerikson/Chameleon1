Interview 9/15/2003 3:20pm
by: Ben
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

>>What he wants
	*syntax highlighting
	*code completion
	*www.parinya.ca
	*www.scintilla.org
	*our ability to port in code from off-the-counter freeware
	*other teams interaction (animated debugger, auto-grader) with us?

>>Requirements
    *The FLEX part of the IDE should provide a basic text-editor.  As time & complexity increase, the editor will provide nearly identical functionality to that of Visual C++, including a command-prompt window and syntax highlighting.
    *Control is to be implemented at our discretion.  Ultimate control for features should be given to the teacher, though students should be allowed to explore on their own.  The idea is of a master switch that makes them AVAILABLE, but not neccesarily open unless the student activates them.
    *The IDE is to include a debugger (import the animated debugger project?) and a terminal window that can connect to the linux servers.
    *Linux is the primary environment to run in.  Then Windows.
    *No preferences with development tools, nor problems with "off the shelf" code.

>>Features
    *debugger (with step functionality)
    *terminal window
    *syntax highlighting
    *code completion (typing class name auto-finishes)
    *%%code hiding%%  (if we can...)
    *master-control to the teacher
    *hidden complexity for simple/beginner students
    *full functionality for advanced students
    *some project handling
    *communication with the Linux servers
    *local / server based runtime for program

>>Documentation notes:
    *loosely follow templates, edit as we see fit

>>Process notes:
    *organize & operate as we see fit
    *suggested: give prog. hours to team leader
    *present deliverables to keep an external order
    *no real restriction to straight-process

>>Review:
	*IDE is run locally
	*2 options for compiling: server or client
	*-therefore, the CLI is very simple.  Still need the SSH session...
	*minimilistic commands?  simple command-line
	*some frustration with Gallagher & his Linux  :)
	
	*2 CLI: the terminal session, the command line thingy

	*IDE is completely GUI.  And there was much rejoicing.  YAY!
	*User is able to have files on local box, server box
	***solution: the save dialogue has 2-pane window.  Pane 1: local.  Pane 2: server
	***solution: two seperate save dialogues.  "Save on Server..." / "Save..."
	***note: compile local, compile server: make the current status obvious
	***solution: switch between remote & local
>>Discussion of issues:
	~the terminal is gonna be one of the most significant
	~SSH library
	~GUI Issues:
		*main function: transfer info from user to "managers"
		*keeps track of windows / frames / boxes / etc
		*doesn't send stuff to user persay, more or less passing from user
		*manager sends own messages
		*manager has to know what isn't allowed?
	~enable / disable issues:
		*showing / hiding of things, so GUI must communicate with PM
		*PM will pass messages, but not much else
	~editing management
		*editor window
		*everything that happens here.  Oui
		*communicates with debugger
		*communicates a little with compiler manager (compiler lets editor know what lines have problems)
	~compiler management
		*deals with terminal management
		*communicates with editor
		*communicates a little with network
		*communicates with debugger?
	~network management
	~CVS issue: e-mail whenever something is committed

	*Submodel notes:
		~little worry about breaking submodel up

Group Meeting 11/02/2003 11:33pm
by: Ben
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
>>Entry:
	-SDD 1.0 in.  2.0 due 13th Nov.
>>Stuff we had to do this week
	-Dave: exec thread -> problems with Cintella compiler, no success compiling.  Question from Ben about -g option in compilation for compiling.
	-Mark: in terms of debugging, using wxWindows "logdebug" for watching errors.  Worked on GUI.  Added debug buttons (play, pause, step over, step into, step out).  Did some work on disabling the save button if no modifications.  Knows how to handle events.
	-Ben: began permissions managing code.  Researched debugger.

>>To do:
	-Ben-->Bring book & get ready for Tuesday to discuss debugger.  Permissions
	-Mark->putting logdebug into section 5.5 of SDD.  Work out debugging buttons in sub-window?
	-Dave->same ole

>>Progress
	*SDD updated!  W00T!  ;)
	*Team meetings Tuesday
		~"Virtual Prof" looks easy to integrate
		~Animated Debugger?  Dave's skeptical. Low level integrate is plausible, but the high-level integration?  Not gonna happen.  Maybe middle of next semester things'll work out, but otherwise... no worries.

	*The Debugger: as simple as Ben had hoped.  Runs in its own window, so it can be piped.  Mark sees similarities with the networking wrapper.

	*Dave: Progress on the WXProcess.  Not integrated with Plink.

>>File manipulation talk
	*File open dialogue
	*SCP Use?  No.  SFTP to list files & port into dialogue.
	*Threading purposes?  Neccesity?
	*Plink can list.  SCP for copy files.  Or maybe just SFTP.

>>Questions
	*Threading with the blocking?
	*Is the terminal such a big deal?  Will it be hidden in most advanced form?
	*Where do we need to stand at end of semester?
		~some semblence of features together & working together.
		~3 WEEKS... and something needs to be put together

>>Stuff to do: (going to Project Manager)
	*Mark: wants to Lookup "The linux Development Platform", start list of items to put together
	*Ben: needs to start coding debugger
	*Dave?  He knows.  :)

	*Dave- tried to get the process class going.  Got distracted.
	*Ben- apparently got the wrong stuff.  Looking for minGW

>>Notes
	*Talk with Jake: doing same thing we're doing?
	*Confusion over Jake's group using the Linux box's GDB & not grabbing minGW.
	*List of specifics working by 20th?

>>Demo time completions (~###~ => optional, ~###% => strongly recommended)
	*Dave: General LVL1 user running.  Open files, ~listing remote files~, ~embedded terminal%, functional debugger
	*Mark: agree.  Text editor is running...
	*ben: no comment
	*Dave: terminal is *sorta* working.

>>Upcomming week:
	*Tuesday: <<<CODE DAY>>>

>>Discussions on the save-file problems.  Solutions for crash errors.
>>Things broken in the initial beta demo:
	-tab names?  fixed
	-caching? fixed
	-saving? working...
>>Release v2!!
	-user interface re-working
		~networking
		~open dialogue: if network connection fails, error message shows but open dialogue shows anyway.  kill.
		~starting Chameleon: clicking "open" results in "unknown network error"
		~Ben needs to play with it.
		~Local / Remote play with items... after / before the open dialogue?  BEFORE: it's standard, easier to code.
		~network transparency with debugging?  how will it make sense to the user?  USE CASE!!!
	-what do we need?
		~terminal (working & embedded).  Doable for next beta?
			*TA telnet?
			*GT code -- provides functionality?  not entirely...
			*Tera-term -- weird liscence... no colors ;).  SSH is an add-on DLL!  oooh.
			*Putty...?  Yanking it out?  Converting?  dave doesn't know... but he's hopeful (last hope??)
			*Plink?
		~Prof Program!

>>What to look for in next meeting:
	*Dave: GT code providing functionality
	     : Putty fixups
	*Mark: Save file dialogue?
	*Ben : Get a professor program running!!  Debugger>> it MUST be working when they're ready for it.
