>>What he wants
	*syntax highlighting
	*code completion
	*www.parinya.ca
	*www.scintilla.org
	*our ability to port in code from off-the-counter freeware
	*other teams interaction (animated debugger, auto-grader) with us?

>>Requirements
    *The FLEX part of the IDE should provide a basic text-editor.  As time & complexity increase, the editor will provide nearly identical functionality to that of Visual C++, including a command-prompt window and syntax highlighting.
    *Control is to be implemented at our discretion.  Ultimate control for features should be given to the teacher, though students should be allowed to explore on their own.  The idea is of a master switch that makes them AVAILABLE, but not neccesarily open unless the student activates them.
    *The IDE is to include a debugger (import the animated debugger project?) and a terminal window that can connect to the linux servers.
    *Linux is the primary environment to run in.  Then Windows.
    *No preferences with development tools, nor problems with "off the shelf" code.

>>Features
    *debugger (with step functionality)
    *terminal window
    *syntax highlighting
    *code completion (typing class name auto-finishes)
    *%%code hiding%%  (if we can...)
    *master-control to the teacher
    *hidden complexity for simple/beginner students
    *full functionality for advanced students
    *some project handling
    *communication with the Linux servers
    *local / server based runtime for program

>>Documentation notes:
    *loosely follow templates, edit as we see fit

>>Process notes:
    *organize & operate as we see fit
    *suggested: give prog. hours to team leader
    *present deliverables to keep an external order
    *no real restriction to straight-process

>>Review:
	*IDE is run locally
	*2 options for compiling: server or client
	*-therefore, the CLI is very simple.  Still need the SSH session...
	*minimilistic commands?  simple command-line
	*some frustration with Gallagher & his Linux  :)
	
	*2 CLI: the terminal session, the command line thingy

	*IDE is completely GUI.  And there was much rejoicing.  YAY!
	*User is able to have files on local box, server box
	***solution: the save dialogue has 2-pane window.  Pane 1: local.  Pane 2: server
	***solution: two seperate save dialogues.  "Save on Server..." / "Save..."
	***note: compile local, compile server: make the current status obvious
	***solution: switch between remote & local
>>Discussion of issues:
	~the terminal is gonna be one of the most significant
	~SSH library
	~GUI Issues:
		*main function: transfer info from user to "managers"
		*keeps track of windows / frames / boxes / etc
		*doesn't send stuff to user persay, more or less passing from user
		*manager sends own messages
		*manager has to know what isn't allowed?
	~enable / disable issues:
		*showing / hiding of things, so GUI must communicate with PM
		*PM will pass messages, but not much else
	~editing management
		*editor window
		*everything that happens here.  Oui
		*communicates with debugger
		*communicates a little with compiler manager (compiler lets editor know what lines have problems)
	~compiler management
		*deals with terminal management
		*communicates with editor
		*communicates a little with network
		*communicates with debugger?
	~network management
	~CVS issue: e-mail whenever something is committed

>>Next Step:
	*break up managers, divy them into research, submodel them
	*create a full "stub" interface with no functionality
	*Submodel notes:
		~little worry about breaking submodel up
		~NEEDS TO KNOW about MESSAGES
		~who you NEED to talk to
		~how you talk to ME
		~how you can RECEIVE messages
	~DUE: 9/25/03
