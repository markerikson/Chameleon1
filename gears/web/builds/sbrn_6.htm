<h3>New Features and Requirements Implemented</h3>

<p><EM>The main purpose of this section is to help Test Engineers know what 
new areas they should specifically be testing.
In this section, you need to list/describe all the new features and requirements 
that were implemented in this new software release.
It is recommended that for all requirements implemented, a hyperlink is provided that

<h3>Reported Problems Fixed</h3>

<p><EM>The main purpose of this section is to help Test Engineers know what 
old areas to test.
They need to verify (1) that the reported problem is fixed, and (2) verify 
that the fix didn't break something that used to work properly (regression testing).
In this section, you need to list all of the PPRs that have been fixed since the 
last release.
A hyperlink should be provided that goes to that specific 
<a href="../ppr/ppr.htm">PPR</a>.
<br>--JC</EM></p>

<h3>Requirements Not Yet Implemented</h3>

areas to NOT report a PPR on.
You don't want the testers wasting time writing a PPR because a requirement 
is not even implemented yet.
In this section, you need to list all known requirements that are still not 
implemented.
A hyperlink should be provided that goes to that specific requirement in the 
<a href="../srs/srs.htm">SRS</a>.
