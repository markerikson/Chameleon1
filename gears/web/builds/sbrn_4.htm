<h2>Software Build Release Notes</h2>

<h3>Software Version 0.4 (built on mm/dd/yy)</h3>
</center>

<hr>
<h3>New Features and Requirements Implemented</h3>

<p><em>The main purpose of this section is to help Test Engineers
know what new areas they should specifically be testing. In this
section, you need to list/describe all the new features and
requirements that were implemented in this new software release.
It is recommended that for all requirements implemented, a
hyperlink is provided that goes to that specific requirement in
the <a href="../srs/srs.htm">SRS</a>.<br>
 --JC</em></p>

<h3>Reported Problems Fixed</h3>

<p><em>The main purpose of this section is to help Test Engineers
know what old areas to test. They need to verify (1) that the
reported problem is fixed, and (2) verify that the fix didn't
break something that used to work properly (regression testing).
In this section, you need to list all of the PPRs that have been
fixed since the last release. A hyperlink should be provided that
goes to that specific <a href="../ppr/ppr.htm">PPR</a>.<br>
 --JC</em></p>

<h3>Requirements Not Yet Implemented</h3>

<p><em>The main purpose of this section is to help Test Engineers
know what areas to NOT report a PPR on. You don't want the
testers wasting time writing a PPR because a requirement is not
even implemented yet. In this section, you need to list all known
requirements that are still not implemented. A hyperlink should
be provided that goes to that specific requirement in the <a
href="../srs/srs.htm">SRS</a>.<br>
 --JC</em></p>

<h3>Modules Included</h3>

<p><em>The main purpose of this section is to help Test Engineers
and Developers know which software modules got included in this
build. This information may be helpful for debugging
integration-type problems. You should provide a hyperlink here to
download the collection of source code that comprised this build
(e.g. <a href="build1src.zip">build1src.zip</a>).<br>
 --JC</em></p>

<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>

<p><em>The main purpose of this section is to help Test Engineers
know how to install the software and use it. If there are any
special instructions, explain them here. In this section, you
need to list/describe all the new features and requirements that
were implemented in this new software release. You should provide
a hyperlink here to download the installation program (e.g. <a
href="setup.zip">setup.zip</a>).<br>
 --JC</em></p>
