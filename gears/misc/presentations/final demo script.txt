Demo

SETUP:
pre "installation"


DO IT:
start it
default: text editor with remote files
type in hello world (no newline at end of file)
type in username & password
try save
ok fingerprint
save remotely as "testprog.cpp"

[phase 1 - terminal, auto indent, highlighting]  
using prof program generate code
enter code & enable
"g++ testprog.cpp" in terminal
"./a.out" in terminal
Do an ls to demonstrate color scrolling

[phase 2 - compiler, local]
enter code (F3D3950010971) & enable
open local "testprog2.cpp"
show of tabs
save "testprog2.cpp" remotely
click compile
see the errors in the compiler tab
fix errors
click compile
ok "need to save" message
save & compile
tab to terminal and run it

[phase 3 - projects]
enter code (34DA1348031611) & enable
create new project
add files (including files to be debugged later)
click compile
show warning under each file

[phase 4 - debugger]
enter code (1A75624935039) & enable
Set a breakpoint on the first line of main, fName
Add a watch on fName
Run the program, which should hit the breakpoint
Add watches for gallagherDance, yugioh, foo, point, and theMonkey (which is a non-existent variable)
Show the output in the IO panel
Single-step through the creation of foo and the assignment of gallagherDance, down to the first .setData()
Step _into_ .setData() and watch the variables change values, and step through the rest of .setData()
Step _over_ .setData()
Step _into_ and _out of_ init()
Set a breakpoint on the cout statement inside of the while loop and hit continue
When the breakpoint is hit, go to the IO tab
Hit step (may need to hit it twice), click on the panel, type in a number, and watch the jaw drop
Step into if(amount), then do a "run to cursor" to the last cout statement after the for loop
Hit continue
When the breakpoint inside the while loop is hit, disable it, 
hit continue, type in a number
when it loops again, type in 0 to exit
Run the program again, hit stop when it hits the first breakpoint.

[phase 5 - advanced compiling]
enter code (C7881014860031) & enable
close project
open another project
click compile
double click the errors
