<h2>Network Connectivity</h2>
 <p>Chameleon provides you with a Network Transparent environment that allows for development and testing of code on the computer in front of you and or on a remote server with equal ease.</p>
 <h3><a name="mode">Remote vs Local</a></h3>
  <p>A remote file is a file that is stored on a remote server.  A local file is a file that is stored on the computer in front of you.</p>
  <p>Most menu and toolbar actions are performed on the file currently being edited.  If the current visible file is a remote file, compilation, debugging, and execution will be run on the remote server.  Local compilation and debugging are currently not implemented.</p>

 <h3><a name="connect">How to connect</a></h3>
  <p>Opening or saving to remote files can be accomplished through the appropriate menu commands, after a correct username, hostname, and password have been entered in the options menu.</p>
  <p>Opening local files can be accomplished whenever, as long as the Local Editing permission has been authorized</p>

 <h3><a name="messages">Common Networking Error Messages</a></h3>

			<dd>This means that the username and password that you used were not accepted on the server you tried connecting to.</dd>
		<dt>"Permssion Denied."</dt>

			<dd>You do not have permission to read the directory or file you are trying to access.</dd>
