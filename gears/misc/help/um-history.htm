<h2>Version History</h2>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Version 1.2, October 24 2007</h3>

<b>Changes</b>

<ul>
<li> ADD: Local compiling!  If the MinGW toolkit is installed on your system, Chameleon can now use it to compile and debug projects on your computer.  Use the Options window to select the path for MinGW (note that both the MinGW and GDB packages need to be downloaded and installed separately from the MinGW website).  </li>
<li> ADD: Breakpoints can be added and removed by clicking in the breakpoint margin.</li>
<li> ADD: Editor tabs can be closed by middle-clicking.</li>
<li> ADD: The "Debug Output" and "Variable Watch" displays can be combined into one tab.</li>
<li> ADD: Files can be opened by dragging them to the Chameleon window.</li>
<li> CHG: The "Variable Watch" display now shows changed values in red.</li>
<li> CHG: Lots of internal code restructuring.</li>
<li> FIX: Double-clicking a project folder would instantly crash Chameleon. </li>
<li> FIX: Creating a single file, saving, closing, reopening, and compiling it would result in the filename being linked twice, causing "multiple definition" errors.</li>


</ul>
</p>

<li> FIX: Fixed annoying repetitive "first chance exception" error caused by updating a non-existent toolbar</li>
<li> FIX: Fixed erratic terminal focus problems</li>
<li> FIX: Fixed crash caused that occurred when editing a previous commandline</li>
