<h2>Compilation</h2>

<h3>Compiling Levels</h3>
<p>Chameleon provides 3 levels of compilation assistance, based on the permissions granted you, and the options you've selected.</p>

 <h4><a name="manual">Manual</a></h4>
  <p>This is the most basic, always available option.  It really means there is no assistance.  You have to do the compilation manually.  Usually you will do this in the terminal.  See the "Using the Terminal" portion of the tutorial for more information.</p>

 <h4><a name="assisted">Assisted</a></h4>
  <p>When this option is activated, a toolbar button becomes available that will allow you to start the compilation on the current file or project automatically.  Chameleon will then display any compiler output in a textbox for you.</p>

 <h4><a name="advanced">Advanced</a></h4>
  <p>When advanced compilation output is activated, Chameleon will automatically scan through the compiler's output and split it up into individual error messages, each showing the line and file that the compiler says the error occurred at.  Double-clicking an error will cause the editor to focus on the file and line listed (sorry, it doesn't auto-magically solve the errors - we're still wishing we had something like that ourselves).</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Compiling files/projects locally is not supported yet.  This feature may be added later</li>
	<li>Compiling is done on the active file.  If this is an individual file, it is compiled by itself.  If the file is part of a project, then the entire project is compiled.</li>
	<li>In order to compile a multi-file project, you must either have a file from that project open and active, or right-click on the project name in the project tree and select "Compile this project"</li>
	
</ul>
