<h2>Compilation</h2>

<h3>Compiling Modes</h3>
<p>Chameleon has two methods of compiling a program: manual and advanced.</p>

 <h4><a name="manual">Manual</a></h4>
  <p>You have to run the compiler yourself.  Usually you will do this in the terminal.  See the "Using the Terminal" portion of the tutorial for more information.</p>

 <h4><a name="advanced">Advanced</a></h4>
  <p>When advanced compilation output is activated, Chameleon will automatically scan through the compiler's output and split it up into individual error messages, each showing the line and file that the compiler says the error occurred at.  Double-clicking an error will cause the editor to focus on the file and line listed (sorry, it doesn't auto-magically solve the errors - we're still wishing we had something like that ourselves).</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Compiling is done on the active file.  If this is an individual file, it is compiled by itself.  If the file is part of a project, then the entire project is compiled.</li>
	<li>In order to compile a multi-file project, you must either have a file from that project open and active, or right-click on the project name in the project tree and select "Compile this project"</li>
	
</ul>
