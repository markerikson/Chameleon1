<h2>Editor</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
The core of any programmer's editor is, of course, the ability to edit source files.  The main area of the Chameleon window is the text editor.  Based on what your professor has authorized, it can help out your programming by automatically indenting text as well as highlighting C++ keywords, strings, and numbers.

<h3>Debugging</h3>
Breakpoints are managed inside the editor, using the right-click popup menu.  Just right-click on a line to add a breakpoint, remove a breakpoint if one exists, clear all breakpoints in the file if any exist, or run the program to a specific line.  A breakpoint is shown as a red circle to the line, and the next line to be executed is indicated by a yellow arrow.
