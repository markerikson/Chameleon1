<h2>Project Management</h2>

 <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Chameleon has the ability to manage projects that contain multiple files.  This is limited to simply listing which files are in a project and need to be compiled, but this is sufficient for most first-year projects.</p>

<h3>Using Projects</h3>
<p>There are two ways to create a new project.  You can right-click the top folder in the project tree on the left side of Chameleon and select "Create New Project" from the popup menu, or select "Create New Project" from the Projects menu on the main menubar.  You'll be asked whether to save this project on the local computer or on the remote server, then asked for a filename for the new project.</p>
<p>Once a project has been created, files can be added to it.  To add a .cpp or .c file to the project, right-click the "Source Files" item in the project tree and select "Add Source File".  To add a .h or .hpp file to the project, right-click the "Header Files" item and select "Add Header File".  To add a library file to the project, right-click the Libraries item and select "Add Library" (please note that this ability is limited in the types of libraries you can use and the places you can browse for them).  Once an item is added to the project, a corresponding item is shown in the project tree.</p>
<p>Files in a project can be completely removed from the project, or can be temporarily excluded from compilation.  Both of these can be done by right-clicking on a file in the project and selecting the appropriate item from the popup menu.  Files in a project that will not be compiled are shown with a blue X over their icon.  Excluded files can be re-enabled for compiling by right-clicking on them and selecting "Include File in Compilation".</p>
