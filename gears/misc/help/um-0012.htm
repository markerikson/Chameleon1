<h2>Compilation</h2>
Chameleon provides 3 levels of compilation assistance, based on the permissions granted you, and the options you've selected.

 <h3><a name="manual">Manual</a></h3>
  <p>This is the most basic, always available option.  It really means there is no assistance.  You have to do the compilation manually.  Usually you will do this in the terminal.</p>

 <h3><a name="assisted">Assisted</a></h3>
  <p>When this option is activate, a button will be in the toolbar that will allow you to start the compilation on the current file or project automatically.  Chameleon will then display any compiler output in a textbox for you.</p>

 <h3><a name="advanced">Advanced</a></h3>
  <p>When this option is active, the assisted compilation button still compiles the current file or project.  But, now the compiler output is presented to you in a useful form.  (No, it does not auto-magically solve the errors.)</p>
