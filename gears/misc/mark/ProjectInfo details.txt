Project class thoughts

Phases:
 * Compiling -> project is read only
 * Debugging -> project is read only
 * Editing -> project is editable

Editor stores a ProjectInfo*, set on instantiation

CW:
 * maintains a ProjectInfo* for a multi-file project
 * On project close:
	- if not closing the application, ask them if they want to close any open files for that project
		* if yes, walk project's editor list, and replace each editor's project with a new single-file project
 * Change "start compile" button to "stop compile" while compiling
	- note that because the user can switch back and forth between files while compiling, the project NEEDS
	  to have an IsCompiling flag so CW can update the compiler button appropriately
	- actually... what happens if the user tries to compile multiple items one after the other?  Any issues?

Compiler:
 * all compiling is now project-based
 * must call proj->SetReadOnly(bool)

Debugger:
 * ProjectInfo* should replace ExecutableFileName, SourceFileNames

ProjectInfo class:
 * should default to "single-file"
 * needs to have:
	- isSingleFile()
	- isModified()
	- isCompiled()
	- SetReadOnly(bool)
	- ExecutableFileName (wxString or wxFileName?)
	- list of source files (in there already)
	- list of open ChameleonEditors that are part of the project
